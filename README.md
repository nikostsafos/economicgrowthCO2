# Economic Growth Without CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions? 

Web version: https://nikostsafos.github.io/economicgrowthCO2/

We need energy to survive&mdash;to light, heat and cool our homes and offices; to preserve and cook food; to transport goods across continents and oceans; to erect structures and build things; to feed animals and extract materials from the earth; to communicate with one another; to play; to live. But what, exactly, is the relationship between incomes and energy consumption? Can we grow an economy without consuming more energy&mdash;more importantly, is economic growth possible without emitting more CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere?

The data for this analysis come from the International Energy Agency, CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion (2016 Edition): https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/co2-emissions-from-fuel-combustion-highlights-2016.html.
